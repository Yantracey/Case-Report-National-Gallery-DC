# Case-Report-National-Gallery-DC

Assigned to examine an iPhone image using Autopsy, I uncovered a case involving Alex, a wealthy businessman with Krasnovian ties, aiming to embarrass America by defacing Foreign Art in the National Gallery. Recruiting Carry, a Krasnovian supporter, Alex orchestrated a plan with Krasnovian militants, facilitated by Carry. Tracy, a National Gallery supervisor, played a role, assisting what she believed was organizing a "Flash mob." Tracy's financial struggles made her overlook the suspicious nature of Carry's requests. Further revelations included Tracy's conspiracy to steal from the National Gallery, documented on her work computer, personal phone, and home computer. Carry, proficient in steganography and encryption, concealed correspondence in steg and encrypted files using a tablet. The plot took an unexpected turn when Joe, Tracy's ex-husband, discovered the conspiracy through a key logger. Reporting it to the police led to the seizure of Carry's devices, exposing both the theft conspiracy and the defacing plot.
